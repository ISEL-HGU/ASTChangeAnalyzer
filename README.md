# ASTChangeAnalyzer

A modulizable code differencing and AST extracting tool through mining Git commits.

## Description

ASTChangeAnalyzer is a tool that mines commit IDs from a designated URL or a local path to extract two ASTs (Abstract Syntax Tree) of before and after the point of the commit.

It has the following features:
* mining diff commits and extract source code
* converting a source file into a language-agnostic tree format (Java and Python supported)
* compute the differences between the trees
* visualize these differences graphically
